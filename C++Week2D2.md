### Co Pilot thoughts

C++ has a set of reserved keywords that cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names). These keywords have special meanings and are part of the language syntax.

Data Type: Represents the different types of floating-point numbers in C++.
Keyword: The specific word used in C++ to declare a variable of that type (e.g., float, double).
Description: Provides information about the precision and use cases for each type.

Demonstrates how division works in C++. Integer division (e.g., 15/4) truncates the decimal part, while floating-point division (e.g., 15/4.0 or 15.0/4) retains it.
