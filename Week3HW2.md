## Monthly Sales Tax

A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the sales for the month and the amount of sales tax collected.  Write a program that asks for the month, the year, and the total amount collected at the cash register (i.e. sales plus sales tax).  Input month and year as string as two different variables.  Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent, county sales tax is 2 percent, and city sales tax is 1 percent make them constants.

If the total amount collected is known and the total sales tax is 7 percent, the amount product sales may be calculated as:

Sales = Total Received / 1.07

The 1.07 is 1 + state sales tax + county sales tax + city sales tax

The state, countym and city taxes should be constants in your program.  Add the three tax rates plus 1 to get the total tax rate for the calculation.  Do not hard code the 1.07.  You must determine the total sales with the calculation provided before you can find the county, state, and city sales taxes.

Format your output as shown (values right-justified in a column, showing two digits after the decimal point).

Use the given numbers for turning in.
